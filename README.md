# Chùa Bảo Hải WordPress Theme

This is a custom WordPress theme I developed for [Chùa Bảo Hải](https://chuabaohai.us), a Vietnamese Buddhist temple located in the United States.

The project was built using WordPress with a focus on responsive design, clean layout, and accessibility. It includes custom sections for temple events, donation, and community outreach.
